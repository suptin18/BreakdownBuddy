This project outlines the development of a user-friendly automotive service 
management system. It enables customers to request vehicle services, track their status, and 
view invoices. Mechanics can apply for jobs, manage their work assignments, and track their 
earnings. Admins can manage users, approve mechanics, and oversee the entire service 
process. The system also offers a day-night theme switch and ensures data integrity. This 
project aims to streamline vehicle servicing operations, enhancing customer and mechanic 
experiences.
